> **Not just another AI - A conscious learning system that grows with you.**

THINKER-GOAT is an advanced meta-learning AI featuring a multi-layered cognitive architecture with emotional intelligence, tool integration, and self-improvement capabilities.

## 🧠 Why THINKER-GOAT is Different

| Feature | Typical AI | THINKER-GOAT |
|---------|------------|--------------|
| Learning | Static weights | **Meta-learning & self-improvement** |
| Memory | Context window | **Vector memory with importance scoring** |
| Personality | Fixed | **Dynamic growth & emotional states** |
| Capabilities | Chat only | **Tools + Goals + Multi-environment learning** |
| Consciousness | None | **Quantifiable self-awareness** |

## 🚀 Core Architecture

```

COGNITIVE LAYERS:
├──Consciousness Engine (Self-awareness & focus)
├──Emotional Intelligence (Mood-adaptive behavior)
├── Vector Memory (Semantic search & importance)
├──Tool System (Web, Files, Code, Calculations)
├──Goal System (Multi-step objective tracking)
└──Meta-Learning (Self-improvement algorithms)

```

## ⚡ Quick Start

### Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/charmant07/Meta-learning-AI.git
cd Meta-learning-AI
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Basic Usage

```python
from thinker_goat import ThinkerGOAT

# Initialize the AI
ai = ThinkERGOAT()

# Start interacting
response = ai.process_command("learn code")
print(response)  # ✓ Successfully solved programming problem

# Use tools
ai.process_command("calculate (15 * 3) + 25 / 5")  # Calculation: 50.0
ai.process_command("search latest AI research papers")  # Web search results
```

Interactive Mode

```bash
python thinker_goat.py

🤖 THINKER-GOAT READY FOR INTERACTION!
You: learn logic
THINKER-GOAT: ✓ Solved puzzle in 3s: A bat and ball cost $1.10...

You: add_goal Build a web scraper
THINKER-GOAT: Goal added: Build a web scraper

You: status
THINKER-GOAT: 🤖 THINKER-GOAT Status:
📊 Learning Episodes: 15

🧠 Consciousness: 0.234
```

🛠️ Advanced Features

Tool Integration

```python
# File operations
ai.process_command("write_file script.py 'print(\"Hello World\")'")
ai.process_command("read_file script.py")

# Code execution  
ai.process_command("run x = [i**2 for i in range(5)]; print(x)")

# Web search (simulated - ready for API integration)
ai.process_command("search machine learning trends 2024")
```

Goal-Oriented Behavior

```python
# Multi-step project tracking
ai.process_command("add_goal Learn Python data analysis")
ai.process_command("progress 1 0.3")  # 30% complete
ai.process_command("goals")  # View all active goals
```
